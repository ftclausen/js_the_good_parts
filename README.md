### My own notes of the seminal Javascript: The Good Parts

There are many notes like these but these are mine. I am not trying to be exhaustive - just jotting things down to help
cement the concepts.

I also rename variables and other small tweaks to make the code more understandable to me. Don't expect consistent
formatting; this is a place where I hammer concepts into my brain.
